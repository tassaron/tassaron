I'm Brianna Rainey, also known as `tassaron`. I love open source software so I create a lot of it on GitHub. I hope you find it useful! [=^.^=](https://github.com/tassaron/nagcat)

* If you like my code, follow me on [Mastodon](https://tassaron.com/@brianna)! 🙂 I mostly post about software. Mastodon also has [RSS!](https://tassaron.com/@brianna.rss)

* I made an [online arcade 🕹️](https://rainey.tech) (which is also my portfolio).

* I've been teaching myself to code for at least a decade now. I guess it's fun or something? See more in [my bio 📖](https://rainey.tech/bio)

* [I also posts gists!🔗](https://gist.github.com/tassaron) Could be the unpolished gem you're looking for ;)
